            <h2>What I Learnt in My Life</h2>
            <h2 class="h2">Overview</h2>
        <p class="para">Learn things through life experiences.
            <br>Hi floks, I am so happy that now I can write about my lessons in my life.
            <br> And if you dont and have some suggestions you can refer me in through connecting me in linkedin.
            <br>I hope life was a sustain and well arranged manner, I hope if it goes in a planned from here. But its a life right!!!
        </p>

        <p class="para"><h2>
           I hope this was known before.</h2>
           <p class="para"> Studying In Medical makes our life good. This was told by my dad's friend and my relatives but i was neter too insterested.
            I came from a familly where most of my relatives are either doctor or government employees and I think I m the 1st gen Engineer in my house.
            After 10th my family and my parent wanted to go to the medical line and become a doctor but i always wanted to be a engineer. After sometimes 
            I got frustared of studies. What am I understand just doing blah blah!!! my parent understood that pushing me to medical will not go in anyones 
            favour. And this this kind of things my studies got hampered. Though I never was a good or studious student. I WAS sleeping in class and made my 1 
            year waste. Then after exam i got suxh a worst result though my parent were like it happnes. Then  I started foccusing on my studies and made a drop
            of 1 year. And after 12th i joined KIIT in EEE and i sometimes think that it will be better if i took CS in my bachalors. And now i can say people who
            has extended education like me can also have a good life and can go into some good companies.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting into KIIT</h2>
        <p class="para">I never dreamt of geting into any good college. Though KIIT is one of top colleges in India but in my mind I was a failure who has extended
            education. Just scored a low score in 12th and from there i was like nothing will happen in my life. I will be a failure. I took EEE  because i had a 
            passion for electronics gadgets. But after 2 year I was like i am in a wrong stream and if i had choosen CS then only i can get a good job. Then again i 
            broke down and like previous this time i was too much devastated. I didn't got any placement from KIIT Because most of the companies will not accept 
            extended education. The ones who are accepting wants 65% carrier and I don't have that and after that I kind of given hope in my life. And also covid happned 
            and some companies didn't came to recruit that year. And wasted another year.
           <br> Though I made some great friends at KIIT who always supported me and I am always thakful to all my friends who i met any pooint of my life</p>
           <h2>Life after KIIT</h2>
        <p class="para">After KIIT i was once again devastated and lost hope to get into any companies and my family agained satrted to say prepare for government job
            as most of the people of my age was doing that and I started preparation for governt exam and after wasting another year i realise govt job was not for me 
            and last october i Joined ABC - Technology Training & Upskilling and learnt java devlopment and in february this year I got offer Letter from Wipro and joined
            in April as a QA Tester and I am enjoing this field and as I always have a insterst in web development and my nephew who is also my Best Friend joined Neog.Camp 
            last year and also another good friend of mine joined here and they suggested me to go with this and here I am. 
            <br>
            Understood that getting a job with extended education in India is Tough but with hard work you can have a good job and carier.
