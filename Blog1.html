            <h2>What I Learnt in My Life</h2>
            <h2 class="h2">Overview</h2>
        <p class="para">Learn things through life experiences.
            <br>I'm so glad I can now share the lessons I've learned in my life with you.
            <br> And if you don't and have some suggestions, you can connect with me on Linkedin.
            <br>From this point on, I hope life went in a sustainable and well-organized manner. But it's a life right!!!
        </p>

        <p class="para"><h2>
           I hope this was known before.</h2>
           <p class="para"> Studying In Medical makes our life good. I was told this by my dad's friend and my relatives, but I wasn't interested.
            I came from a family where most of my relatives are either doctors or government employees and I am the 1st gen Engineer in my house.
            After my 10th grade, my family and my parents wanted me to become a doctor, but I wanted to be an engineer. After sometimes I got 
            frustrated with my studies. What am I understanding just doing blah blah!!! My parent understood that pushing me to medical will not 
            go in anyone's favour. And for this kind of thing my studies got hampered. Though I never was a good or studious student. I was 
            sleeping in class and made a year waste. Then after the exam, I got such a worst result though my parent was like it happened. Then  
            I started focusing on my studies and made a drop of 1 year. And after 12th I joined KIIT in EEE and I sometimes think that it will be
            better if I took CS for my bachelor's. And now I can say people who have extended education like me can also have a good life and can 
            go into some good companies.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting into KIIT</h2>
        <p class="para">I never dreamt of getting into any good college. Though KIIT is one of the top colleges in India in my mind I was a failure 
            who has extended education. Just scored a low score in 12th and from there I was like nothing will happen in my life. I will be a failure. 
            I took EEE  because I had a passion for electronic gadgets. But after 2 years I was like I am in the wrong stream and if I had chosen CS 
            then only I can get a good job. Then again I broke down and like the previous time I was too devastated. I didn't get any placement from 
            KIIT Because most companies will not accept extended education. The ones who are accepting want 65% carrier and I don't have that and 
            after that, I kind of gave hope in my life. And also covid happened and some companies didn't come to recruit that year. And wasted another year.
           <br> Though I made some great friends at KIIT who always supported me and I am always thankful to all my friends who I met any point of my life</p>
           <h2>Life after KIIT</h2>
        <p class="para">After KIIT I was once again devastated and lost hope to get into any companies and my family again started to say prepare for a government job
            as most of the people of my age were doing that and I started preparation for government exam and after wasting another year I realise govt job was not for me 
            and the last October i Joined ABC - Technology Training & Upskilling and learnt java development and in February this year I got an offer letter from Wipro and joined
            in April as a QA Tester and I am enjoying this field as I always have an interest in web development my nephew who is also my Best Friend joined Neog.Camp 
            last year and also another good friend of mine joined here and they suggested me to go with this and here I am. 
            <br>
            Understood that getting a job with extended education in India is Tough but with hard work you can have a good job and career.
